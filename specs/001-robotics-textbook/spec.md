# Feature Specification: Textbook for Teaching Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course

**Feature Branch**: `001-robotics-textbook`
**Created**: 2025-12-04
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Create a Textbook for Teaching Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course..."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Acquire Core Knowledge (Priority: P1)

A university student or early-career engineer wants to learn the fundamentals of physical AI and humanoid robotics, including ROS 2, Gazebo, NVIDIA Isaac, and VLA integration, to gain practical application skills and understand the measurable ROI of classroom AI through evidence-based applications.

**Why this priority**: This story represents the primary learning objective and value proposition of the textbook for the target audience. Without core knowledge acquisition, other features are less impactful.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by evaluating the reader's understanding of key concepts and their ability to explain the ROI of classroom AI after completing the relevant modules.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** a student with introductory AI knowledge, **When** they read Module 1 (ROS 2 fundamentals), **Then** they can explain the core concepts and practical implementations of ROS 2.
2.  **Given** a student who has completed the textbook, **When** they reflect on the content, **Then** they can explain the ROI of classroom AI with specific case examples.

---

### User Story 2 - Reproduce Technical Examples (Priority: P1)

A student wants to reproduce the code and simulation setups provided in the textbook to gain hands-on experience and verify their understanding of the technical implementations.

**Why this priority**: Hands-on reproducibility is critical for practical skill development and reinforcing theoretical concepts in an engineering textbook. Without this, the practical focus is diminished.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by having students set up and run selected code and simulation examples from each module and verify their outputs against expected results.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** a student following the textbook's instructions, **When** they attempt to set up and run any of the 5+ code/sim setups per module, **Then** all setups run without errors and produce expected results.
2.  **Given** a student completing the relevant sections (Modules 2, 3, 4), **When** they attempt to set up and run a basic humanoid simulation using Gazebo/Unity or NVIDIA Isaac, **Then** they can successfully achieve this.

---

### User Story 3 - Utilize Interactive Features (Priority: P2)

A student wants to use the integrated RAG chatbot, content personalization, and translation features to enhance their learning experience, clarify concepts, and adapt the content to their needs.

**Why this priority**: These features provide significant value-add for personalized and accessible learning, supporting diverse student needs beyond the core content.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by verifying the functionality of each interactive feature (chatbot accuracy, personalization application, translation correctness) in isolated user sessions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** a student using the RAG chatbot, **When** they ask a question about the book content or select a text snippet, **Then** the chatbot provides a grounded answer strictly from the textbook content.
2.  **Given** a student enabling content personalization, **When** they navigate through chapters, **Then** the content adapts according to their specified background (software/hardware experience).
3.  **Given** a student activating the Urdu translation, **When** they view a chapter, **Then** the chapter content is accurately translated into Urdu.

### Edge Cases

-   What happens if a student has difficulty setting up the required software (ROS 2, Gazebo, NVIDIA Isaac, etc.) due to environment conflicts or missing dependencies? (The textbook should provide clear, detailed setup instructions, potentially leveraging containerization (e.g., Docker) or virtual environments, and a dedicated troubleshooting section).
-   How does the system handle an empty or invalid query to the RAG chatbot? (The chatbot should gracefully inform the user about the invalid input and guide them on how to ask effective questions).
-   What if the user attempts to personalize content without completing the background questionnaire? (The system should prompt the user to complete the questionnaire first or use a default personalization setting).
-   How does the system ensure the accuracy and cultural nuance of the Urdu translation? (Leverage robust translation APIs and potentially offer a feedback mechanism for translation improvements).

## Out of Scope

1.  **Comprehensive literature review** of the entire AI field (focus is on practical application in physical robotics).
2.  **Hardware assembly manual** or detailed physical setup guides for robots (focus on software, simulation, and integration).
3.  **Comparison of specific AI products/vendors** or commercial robot vendors (focus on open-source tools and general principles).
4.  **Discussion of ethical concerns** in AI/robotics beyond the high-level themes outlined in the governance charter (reserved for separate paper/resource if needed).
5.  **Implementation guide or code examples** beyond the 5+ per module threshold, intended to be illustrative rather than exhaustive.
6.  **Full production-ready codebases** or proprietary SDK integrations (examples are for educational purposes).
