# Tasks: AI Physical Robotics Textbook

## Feature Overview
Create a comprehensive textbook for teaching Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics to university students and early-career engineers, covering ROS 2, Gazebo, NVIDIA Isaac, and VLA integration with practical, reproducible examples.

## Dependencies
- Complete spec.md and plan.md for the robotics textbook feature
- Basic development environment with access to ROS 2, Gazebo, and documentation resources

## Parallel Execution Examples
- Module 1 and Module 2 content can be developed in parallel after foundational setup
- Academic research for different modules can occur simultaneously
- Code examples for each module can be developed independently

## Implementation Strategy
- Start with foundational content and basic structure (MVP)
- Implement one module at a time with all associated examples
- Integrate academic sources throughout the development process
- Validate each module independently before proceeding to the next
