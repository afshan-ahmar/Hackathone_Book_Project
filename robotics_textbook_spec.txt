Success Criteria (Combined):

**1. Application & Evidence Requirements:**
- Identify 3+ concrete AI applications in physical robotics with supporting evidence
- Include 8+ peer-reviewed academic sources (2014-2024) demonstrating AI effectiveness
- All technical claims supported by official documentation or industry examples
- Reader can explain ROI of classroom AI after reading, with specific case examples

**2. Technical Depth Requirements:**
- Cover all 4 modules with hands-on examples and explanations:
  - Module 1: ROS 2 fundamentals with practical implementations
  - Module 2: Gazebo & Unity simulations with setup examples
  - Module 3: NVIDIA Isaac integration with working examples
  - Module 4: VLA convergence with implementation guidance
- Include 5+ reproducible code/sim setups per module with verification steps
- Reader can set up and run a basic humanoid simulation after reading the relevant sections

**3. Practical Outcomes:**
- Clearly demonstrate how each AI application translates to educational ROI
- Provide verifiable examples showing learning acceleration or skill development
- Show pathway from classroom learning to industry-relevant skills

Constraints (Unified & Prioritized):

**Scope & Format:**
- **Total Word Count:** 10,000-20,000 words total (2000-4000 per module)
- **Structure:** Module-by-module drafting completed within 1 month
- **Format:** Markdown source with:
  - APA citations for academic references
  - Inline links to official documentation, tutorials, and repos
  - Clear demarcation between evidence-based research and practical implementation
- **Source Requirements:**
  - 8+ peer-reviewed journal articles (2014-2024)
  - Official documentation, open-source repos, and tutorials (2019-2024)
  - Industry case studies showing real-world AI deployment success

**Timeline:**
- Complete draft within 1 month (module-by-module approach)
- Allow for 2 weeks of refinement if needed from original timeline

Not Building (Combined Exclusions):

1. **Comprehensive literature review** of entire AI field
2. **Hardware assembly manual** or detailed physical setup guides
3. **Comparison of specific AI products/vendors** or commercial robot vendors
4. **Discussion of ethical concerns** in AI/robotics (reserved for separate paper/resource)
5. **Implementation guide or code examples** beyond the 5+ per module threshold
6. **Full production-ready codebases** or proprietary SDK integrations
