Part 1: Foundations
Overview
Welcome to the foundational part of our journey into Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. This section establishes the core concepts, mathematical principles, and fundamental knowledge necessary to understand how humanoid robots work. Whether you're a student, researcher, or enthusiast, mastering these foundations will prepare you for the advanced topics in subsequent parts.

What You'll Learn
Chapter 1: Introduction
Explore the landscape of physical AI and humanoid robotics, understanding the historical context, current state-of-the-art systems, and the grand challenges facing the field today.

Chapter 2: Mathematical Foundations
Build your mathematical toolkit with linear algebra, calculus, probability theory, and optimization techniques essential for robot modeling and control.

Chapter 3: Robot Anatomy
Dive into the mechanical structure of humanoid robots, exploring actuators, sensors, materials, and the design principles that bring these machines to life.

Chapter 4: Kinematics Fundamentals
Learn how to mathematically describe robot motion, from forward kinematics to inverse kinematics, enabling precise control of robot limbs and joints.

Chapter 5: Dynamics Control
Understand the forces and torques that govern robot motion, and discover control strategies that enable stable, responsive movement in dynamic environments.

Prerequisites
Before diving into this part, you should have:

Basic programming knowledge (Python recommended)
High school level mathematics (algebra, trigonometry)
Curiosity about robotics and AI
Access to a computer for running code examples
Why Start Here?
Physical AI is fundamentally different from traditional software AI. While algorithms and neural networks are important, humanoid robots must also:

Obey the laws of physics
Maintain balance against gravity
Generate precise forces and torques
Sense their environment through imperfect sensors
Operate under strict energy and time constraints
Understanding these physical constraints and capabilities is essential before tackling advanced topics like machine learning, computer vision, or motion planning. These foundational chapters provide the vocabulary, mathematical framework, and conceptual models you'll use throughout the rest of the book.

How to Use This Part
For Beginners: Read chapters sequentially, working through examples and exercises. Don't rush—these concepts build on each other.

For Experienced Practitioners: Use this part as a reference to refresh specific topics or fill knowledge gaps. Each chapter is relatively self-contained.

For Educators: These chapters provide a structured curriculum for a semester-long introductory course in humanoid robotics.

What's Next?
After completing Part 1, you'll be ready to explore:

Part 2: Core technologies including sensors, computer vision, and machine learning
Part 3: Advanced topics in robot design, locomotion, and human-robot interaction
Part 4: Cutting-edge frontiers in soft robotics, quantum computing, and ethics
Let's begin building the foundation for creating intelligent, capable humanoid robots!
